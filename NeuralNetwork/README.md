## Neural Network Sample

### Tech
Clientside Javascript - no frameworks

### Description
This clientside javascript sample is a component in a neural network I developed after teaching myself the 
foundational maths of machine learning and wanted to put it into practice.

The network is trained under a genetic simulation, and results in "Creatures" who can navigate a world (in JS canvas) and hunt for food.

The code as a whole was structured to allow easy addition of creature faculties using extensable classes, and quick modification of constants to adjust and review behavior in order to optimize the network.
